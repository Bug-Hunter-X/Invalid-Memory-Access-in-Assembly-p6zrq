mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10] ; This instruction attempts to access memory at an invalid address.

This can happen if:

* ebx is pointing to an invalid memory location.
* esi contains an out-of-bounds index.
* The combination of ebx and esi results in an address outside the program's allocated memory space.
