# Assembly Code Bug: Invalid Memory Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory at an invalid address. The bug arises from incorrect pointer arithmetic or an out-of-bounds index, leading to a segmentation fault.

## Bug Description
The instruction `mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]` attempts to read data from memory using calculated address.  If any of the registers (ebx, esi) hold incorrect values or the offset 0x10 leads to an address outside of allowed memory space, a segmentation fault occurs.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the values of ebx and esi before performing the memory access.  Appropriate bounds checking is crucial to prevent accessing memory outside the program's allocated range.
